**House Price prediction of houses in King County**

This is the analysis of KC house price dataset from Kaggle using the Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.

In this analysis, I have done EDA to understand the variables, followed by model fitting. I have experimented with different Decision Tree models by tuning the hyperparameters and with Linear Regression models by selecting different sets of predictors. I have followed forward selection method to select the features for Multiple Linear Regression model. I have also performed some feature transformations like log transformations, creating a new feature using the existing features and used dummy variables.
